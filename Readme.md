# Readme

This is a 2d rendering engine that I wrote to learn Rust & wgpu. It is in very _early_ development. No API stability guaranteed.

I have recently updated it so it should build with wgpu 0.10.

## Requirements

To be able to build mat_engine, you will need
`cmake` and `ninja` in your PATH.
